# History of Bitcoin

Bitcoin is the 1st decentralized cryptocurrency, leveraging blockchain technology to enable peer-to-peer digital transactions without intermediaries (in traditional systems we are dependent on Banks to settle any monetary transaction and Banks take care of maintaining the ledger, old system worked so far but has lot of drawbacks. New system uses Blockchain technology which is superior).

The first cryptocurrency was bitcoin, which was first released as open-source software in 2009. It's hard work of 40 years done by computer geeks (a.k.a cyber-punks, you'll learn more in pre-history section).

As of Nov 2024, there were 25,000+ other cryptocurrencies in the marketplace, out of them several are either dead or of no-use.

### What is Bitcoin Halving?

Bitcoin halving is a pre-programmed event in the Bitcoin network that reduces the reward miners receive for mining new blocks by half. It occurs approximately every 210,000 blocks, or roughly every four years, as part of Bitcoin’s deflationary monetary policy.
