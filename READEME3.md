#₿(Bitcoin)- Designing your Own Customized Investment Portfolio (Part#4)

This topic is to share my learning during designing of my own BTC portfolio process. Goal is to giving you stepping stone, so you can design your own customized BTC portfolio. I have made few assumptions to keep examples and calculations easy to grasp, due to different risk appetite and age group few calculations (related to salary and portfolio % toward BTC investment) might differ for individual investors.

BTC Investing **Strategy:**
---------------------------

**Step#1** **BTC Investment %age:** Calculate **5%** of your total investment portfolio you want to invest into BTC in any given year (if you asking why 5% only, then see [Bitcoin_Part#3_Topic#3](https://vinaybaatcheet.wordpress.com/2025/01/03/part-3-bitcoin/)).

**Step#2** **DCA:** Instead of waiting for BTC price to dip, start daily **DCA**(dollar cost avg.), as this is human tendency to think too much of price vs market sentiments. Still, if BTC dip enough (say 30% to 70% draw down happened in past, but don't worry Step#3 will take care of that risk), then totally make sense to buy in big chunks. During this period, whenever BTC price drops, it's really **+ve news for us** to add more fractions of BTC at a cheap prices. I hope BTC to remain cheap till 2030, so more retail investors gets time to invest into BTC.

**Step#3 Number of min. Investing Years:** Keep accumulating (HODL) for **4 to 5 years**, so you will cross next halving cycle (it takes approx. 6 to 12 months after any halving to get Bull cycle to kick in, which means **March 2028** will be next halving then at least keep accumulating till **Jan 2029**).

**Note:** I am not too rigid about **Step#1** and **Step#2** (person can adjust per their needs), but **Step#3** accumulation period need to remain fixed (as this is where magic happens, it's very difficult to time the market for seasoned investors so forgot about me and you).

**Example:**
------------

-   Taking few salary numbers (e.g. **in USA as $100K and in India ₹10 lakh**) assumption for simplification in the calculations.

-   Next halving cycle lets make some prediction assumption, for **bear, crab(neutral) or bull** market scenarios (this number might differ but I am taking some avg. estimates). Considering BTC avg. price during writing of this article **Jan 2025 is b/w $90K and $100K.**

-   As we are DCA bitcoin everyday, so avg. accumulation for our example is **0.2 BTC (for USA) and 0.02 (for India)**. Now, lets see the profits after next halving cycle (2028 - 2029) for different type of markets.

**Note**: As per estimates, BTC is still growing avg. 50% to 60%, after 10 to 15 years it'll surely reduce to 20%. So, achieving **50%, 150% or 400%** in 4 years seems possible w.r.t to different kind of market (it's safe estimate).

**Conclusion**: There are fair chances that in bull case after 4 years **$20K** can turn into **$100K** and for an Indian investor their **₹2 lakh** turn into **₹10 lakh**.

Please feel free to look at original [Excel Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/15CVooI68gb2pkhi9sLaZW7SmJjocTeD-VEgMc-HuZ8g/edit?usp=sharing) I used for above example, you can copy and make changes to any number or calculations per your customized portfolio.

**Comparing Global Market & How much money might enter into BTC in coming future?**
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I am inviting two of our teachers to guide us here, 1st is **Michael Saylor** explained global wealth while explaining recently to Microsoft (i.e. total $**900 T** global wealth and current **BTC** is just **$2T** market cap) and 2nd friend our Canadian Bitcoin maxi **Greg Foss** explaining us about probability of **BTC to reach b/w $200K** and **$2M** few years back.

![](https://vinaybaatcheet.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/screenshot-2025-01-13-at-12.07.13e280afam.png?w=1024)

**Greg Foss** is math genius and beautifully explained bear case (90% prob.) and bull case (10% prob.), and give BTC $200K will be sure and it's math, he has not predicted when it will happen but this content he published few years back. Incase, you adjust the probability b/w bear and bull markets then BTC price might land b/w **$200K and $2M** seems possible.

**Conclusion:**
---------------

Now, is it possible that current banking industry or fiat system will be replaced by one of best global money i.e. **BTC** which is running solid and strong **24/7** since **2009** without any centralized control? This is reminding me about phrase *"[**Bitcoin** is a swarm of cyber hornets serving the **goddess of wisdom**, feeding on the **fire of truth**, exponentially growing ever](https://vinaybaatcheet.wordpress.com/2024/10/16/bitcoin-as-cyber-hornet-m-saylor/) **[smarte](https://vinaybaatcheet.wordpress.com/2024/10/16/bitcoin-as-cyber-hornet-m-saylor/)***[**r, faster, and stronger**.](https://vinaybaatcheet.wordpress.com/2024/10/16/bitcoin-as-cyber-hornet-m-saylor/)"

Time will tell us how correct is this math and lets keep speculation part open for individual person and I am not here to pass any judgement. I think my job is learn from others and share my learning within investing community. This is my humble effort to break down these topic in few parts, with unwavering support and encouragement from my **family and friends** with whom I regularly bouncing my ideas and shameless asking to review my articles to get feedback and better these articles for my readers.

*I have fair assumption that once our portfolio clear this 4 to 5 years of **gravitation pull**, then you can relax and find a new gig! **Keep Learning & Keep HODLing!!!***
