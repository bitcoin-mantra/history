# Learn â‚¿(Bitcoin) from the best in the industry (Part#2)

Great you have made to Part#3 of the Bitcoin series! Today we'll draw our attention toward some critical points before you start investing to Bitcoin:

-   **Do Your Research(DYR):** Understand Bitcoin, blockchain technology, and market dynamics.
-   **Start Small:** Invest only what you can afford to lose.
-   **Diversify:** Consider Bitcoin as a be part of a balanced investment portfolio.
-   **Secure Your Investment:** Use trusted wallets and exchanges to minimize risks of theft or fraud.

Investing in Bitcoin isn't for everyone, but for those who align with its principles and are prepared for its risks, it can be a rewarding venture if you consider it for long term instead of having trading mindset.

**#1 Who Should Invest in Bitcoin?**
------------------------------------

-   **Long-Term Investors (**in crypto world we call them **HODLers,** HODL is a crypto slang which means to buy-and-hold indefinitely**)**. Here, I am considering holding time of min. 4 to 5 years as it's correlated to bitcoin halving cycle and it's projected price calculation.
-   **Inflation Hedge:** One looking for **hedge** against **inflation** and **fiat** currency **devaluation** (this can be more realized in weak currencies e.g. Lebanon and Argentina are latest examples where their currencies devalued **75% to 90%** in quick span of time. But, sometimes we think this will not impact me, lets take another example, after covid b/w 2020 to 2022, home prices increased by an estimated **20-30%** in many parts of the U.S.).
-   **Fixed Supply:** As, we learned in [Part#1](https://vinaybaatcheet.wordpress.com/2024/11/26/history-of-bitcoin-pre-history-genesis-block-satoshi-bitcoin-holding/) **Bitcoin halving topic and limited supply (21 million coins)** drives long-term scarcity and value. I also mentioned original source, my recommendation to open post on laptop and view content in full size. Lets revisit original Reddit [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1gqafju/bitcoin_has_followed_a_consistent_4year_cycle_for/#lightbox),
-   and remember next halving will around March 2028 (For me time b/w two halving is accumulation period, you can track halving using free resource like <https://bitbo.io/halving/>)
-   **Freedom**: Bitcoin aligns with principles of self-sovereignty and resistance to centralized control. Put some effort in learning about self custody (i.e. how to move your bitcoin from exchanges to hot or cold wallets, once you have enough accumulation e.g. greater than $1000). Also, there are lot of incidents of exchange hacks, so this practice will safeguard you from such events.

**#2 Who Should Avoid Investing in Bitcoin?**
---------------------------------------------

-   **Risk-Averse Individuals:** Those who cannot tolerate significant price swings or the risk of losing their investment.
-   **Uninformed Investors:** Those who don't understand Bitcoin's fundamentals or how it works.
-   **People with Short-Term Needs:** If you need liquidity within a few months, Bitcoin's volatility makes it a poor choice.

**#3 How much of your portfolio should be invested in Bitcoin?**
----------------------------------------------------------------

Allocate only a small percentage of the portfolio (e.g., 1-5%) to Bitcoin in-order to begin with, if you feel this asset class is too risky. So, this will not give a person heart attack if price drops severely in any given year. Lets say ~ **5% of your portfolio going to zero** (due to severe bear market) won't bring you on the road as I assume 95% of your portfolio is still invested in traditional fiat instruments like **Stock / ETF's, Gold, Real Estate, Retirement funds & Cash**.

If you holds bitcoin for 4 year cycle then your investment will grow enough and this will also give you time to research on Bitcoin. Below are past few years of return for Bitcoin (still growing average ~ 50% to 60 % every year and after 2030 prediction are as volatility reduces with time will still grow 20% per year.):

**#4 Am I late to Invest into Bitcoin?**
----------------------------------------

No, you're not necessarily late to invest in Bitcoin. While Bitcoin has seen significant price increases since its inception, its adoption is still in the early when viewed in the context of global markets and retail side. Bitcoin is often compared to gold, with its market cap. As institutional adoption grows and Bitcoin's use cases expand, there is room for significant value appreciation. Global Bitcoin ownership remains low, with only a fraction of the world's population owning any Bitcoin. Adoption by institutions, corporations, and nation-states is still in its infancy.

**#5 Should I think of any other Cryptocurrencies or Alt-coins?**
-----------------------------------------------------------------

![](https://vinaybaatcheet.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/cryptomarketcap.png?w=725)

-   **Proven Track Record:** Bitcoin is the 1st cryptocurrency and has operated without interruption since its inception in 2009 by **Satoshi Nakamoto**. It has survived market crashes, regulatory scrutiny, and technological challenges, proving its resilience and security.
-   **Decentralization**: Bitcoin is the most decentralized cryptocurrency, with thousands of nodes worldwide ensuring network security and censorship resistance.
-   **Security:** Bitcoin's network is secured by the most powerful computing force in the world, making it nearly immune to hacking or tampering. Altcoins often rely on smaller, less secure networks, making them more vulnerable.
-   **Scarcity**: Bitcoin's fixed supply (21 million coins) which enhances its value as a store of wealth, whereas many altcoins lack hard caps or have inflationary tokenomics, diluting their value over time.
-   **Adoption**: Bitcoin is widely recognized and accepted by institutions, corporations, and governments.
-   **Network Effect:** Bitcoin benefits from the first-mover advantage and a strong network effect. It's the most trusted cryptocurrency and the benchmark for the entire market.

**Conclusion**: Better to ignore other cryptocurrencies, this will reduce noise and give you time to focus on one single best digital money. Once you understand basics and develop confidence with bitcoin then you can easily grasp other innovation and projects.

**#6 Why Bitcoin is considered as Digital Gold?**
-------------------------------------------------

![](https://vinaybaatcheet.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/gold.png?w=720)

Bitcoin is considered "Digital Gold" because it combines many of gold's characteristics---scarcity, durability, resistance to manipulation, and value preservation---with the advantages of digital technology, such as portability, divisibility, and accessibility. While it doesn't have the centuries-long track record of gold, Bitcoin's growing adoption and recognition as a store of value position it as a modern alternative to physical gold in the digital age.

**#7 Is Bitcoin proves Mahatma Gandhi's quote correct?**
--------------------------------------------------------

Mahatma Gandhi's famous quote **"First they ignore you, then they laugh at you, then they fight you, then you change the world."** from his book *"An Autobiography: The Story of My Experiments with Truth"*.

![](https://vinaybaatcheet.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/da1dbae4fac1f03e5c2cad8926d2ce98.jpg?w=610)

Initially, Bitcoin was **dismissed** as a fringe concept, with many in the first world ridiculing it as "internet money" with no intrinsic value. Media narratives often painted it as a tool for illicit activities, from money laundering to drug trafficking.

-   **2013**: Warren Buffett called Bitcoin a "mirage." & Charlie Munger called Bitcoin as Rat Poison.
-   **2017**: Jamie Dimon, CEO of JPMorgan Chase, referred to it as a "fraud" and threatened to fire employees trading it.

The first world's established financial systems **cursed** Bitcoin because it challenged their monopoly on money creation, control, and distribution. Bitcoin's promise of a peer-to-peer financial system removed intermediaries, threatening traditional banking revenue streams and central bank authority. Several governments introduced legislation to curb Bitcoin adoption:

-   **China (2017)**: Banned cryptocurrency exchanges and Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs).
-   **India (2018)**: Imposed banking restrictions on cryptocurrency businesses.
-   **European Union and U.S.**: Proposed stringent Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) regulations.

Over time, first-world nations began to **recognize** Bitcoin's potential rather than solely focusing on its risks. As institutional adoption grew and Bitcoin's legitimacy solidified, the **narrative shifted**:

-   **Major Corporations**: Companies like Tesla, MicroStrategy, and PayPal embraced Bitcoin, integrating it into their balance sheets and payment systems.
-   **Regulated Products**: The approval of Bitcoin ETFs (Exchange-Traded Funds) in countries like Canada and ongoing discussions in the U.S. highlight its growing acceptance.
-   **Government Interest**: El Salvador's move to adopt Bitcoin as legal tender forced developed nations to reassess Bitcoin's role in the global economy.

**#8 Why it's Hard to Wrap your Head around Bitcoin?**
------------------------------------------------------

Bitcoin can be difficult to understand for many people because it challenges conventional ideas about money, technology, and financial systems. Its decentralized, digital, and innovative nature introduces concepts that are unfamiliar to those accustomed to traditional systems:

![](https://vinaybaatcheet.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/conservation-2.png?w=750)

-   **Unfamiliar Concept of Money:** Most people are used to physical money (cash) or centralized digital money (bank accounts). Bitcoin, being purely digital and decentralized, forces us to rethink what gives money value. Unlike gold or cash, Bitcoin has no physical presence. Its value lies in its network, scarcity, and security, which are abstract for many.
-   **Complex Tech:** Blockchain Basics( which involves cryptography, decentralized ledgers, and consensus mechanisms like Proof of Work), Mining Process (computers solving cryptographic puzzles) & Security Features (private keys, wallets, and seed phrases can be confusing, as they differ from traditional banking).
-   **Decentralization Is Unfamiliar**: People are accustomed to trusting central banks, governments, and financial institutions to manage money. Bitcoin's decentralized nature removes these intermediaries, requiring users to trust the technology instead. After Responsibility Shift, now with Bitcoin, individuals are solely responsible for securing their funds. Losing private keys means losing access to Bitcoin forever.

Understanding Bitcoin requires unlearning some traditional ideas about money and embracing a new digital, decentralized paradigm. While the learning curve is steep, the rewards of understanding and potentially adopting Bitcoin can be profound.

**#9 Is Bitcoin a Tulip Mania Bubble?**
---------------------------------------

![](https://vinaybaatcheet.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/tulipmania.jpg?w=1024)

-   Bitcoin has real-world applications and is used as **store of value**, **medium of exchange** in peer-to-peer and cross-border transactions & **financial sovereignty** in regions with unstable currencies or limited banking access. **Tulips** value was based solely on novelty and aesthetics, with no broader utility or lasting significance.
-   Bitcoin is underpinned by **blockchain technology**, a revolutionary system for secure, decentralized record-keeping.
-   Tulips could be grown indefinitely, increasing supply over time. Bitcoin is inherently scarce, with a hard cap of 21 million coins built into its protocol.
-   Tulip Mania was a short-lived craze with no lasting societal impact. Bitcoin has seen steady adoption by individuals, corporations, and even governments. Self-reinforcing cycle does not apply to tulips, which lacked a technological infrastructure or ongoing demand beyond speculation.
-   Bitcoin has existed since 2009, surviving numerous market crashes, regulatory scrutiny, and technological challenges, proving its resilience.
-   Bitcoin has a robust and growing global market, with billions of dollars traded daily. Tulips lacked liquidity and a global market, which contributed to their rapid price collapse.

**#10 Bitcoin is Not an Energy Efficient?**
-------------------------------------------

Bitcoin's network consumes an estimated 100--150 terawatt-hours (TWh) annually, placing it on par with the energy consumption of small-to-medium-sized countries, such as the **Netherlands or Argentina** (which is true fact).

Now, lets look at **Traditional Finance** and other comparisons. Consider global banking system (banks, ATMs, data centers) consumes vast amounts of energy, often exceeding Bitcoin's usage when aggregated. Whereas, growing percentage of Bitcoin mining uses renewable energy sources. Some studies suggest that over 50% of Bitcoin mining is powered by renewable energy, as miners gravitate toward cheap and abundant electricity, often found in hydroelectric or wind-powered regions.

**Stranded Energy:** Bitcoin mining can utilize energy that would otherwise go to waste, such as surplus power from hydroelectric plants or flare gas from oil fields. So, it's best to utilize waste energy and produce and support sound monetary system. **Streaming Services:** Energy used by platforms like YouTube, Netflix, and data centers also rivals small countries. These services are rarely criticized for their energy demands. **Perspective Matters:** Energy usage alone isn't inherently bad; what matters is the societal value it creates. Bitcoin provides global financial inclusion and security, a significant utility. 
The industry is actively shifting toward cleaner energy sources and can drive innovation in renewable energy.
