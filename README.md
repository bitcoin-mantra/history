# History of Bitcoin

Bitcoin is the **1st** decentralized cryptocurrency, leveraging blockchain technology to enable peer-to-peer digital transactions without intermediaries (in traditional systems we are dependent on Banks to settle any monetary transaction and Banks take care of maintaining the ledger, old system worked so far but has lot of drawbacks. New system uses Blockchain technology which is superior).

The first cryptocurrency was bitcoin, which was released as open-source software in 2009. It's hard work of **40 years** done by computer geeks (a.k.a **cyber-punks**, you'll learn more in pre-history section).

As of Nov 2024, there were 25,000+ other cryptocurrencies in the marketplace, out of them several are either dead or of no-use.

## Key Details

- Creator: **Satoshi Nakamoto** (anonymous entity or group)

- Whitepaper Release: October 31, 2008

- Bitcoin Software Release: January 9, 2009

- Genesis Block (Block 0): Mined on January 3, 2009

- Message in Genesis Block: _"The Times 03/Jan/2009 Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks"_

## Bitcoin Price w.r.t Time and Milestones achieved so-far... (Bitcoin Halving?)

### What is Bitcoin Halving?

Bitcoin halving is a pre-programmed event in the Bitcoin network that reduces the reward miners receive for mining new blocks by half. It occurs approximately every 210,000 blocks, or roughly every four years, as part of Bitcoin’s deflationary monetary policy.

### Milestones:
- **Reached $1: February 2011** Bitcoin gained initial recognition and crossed the $1 mark during early adoption.

- **Reached $100: April 2013** Increased interest from tech enthusiasts and early investors drove the price upward.

- **Reached $1,000: November 2013** Fueled by speculative interest, it briefly crossed $1,000 before facing a significant correction.

- **Reached $10,000: November 2017** Bitcoin's surge was driven by institutional interest, increased adoption, and global media coverage.

- **Reached $100,000: December 2024** Reaching $100K milestone on Dec 5 is breaking a psychological level, registered in history after the 4th halving and spot BTC ETF approvals within USA.

### ETA for Future Milestones

**$1,000,000**: $1M Optimistic forecasts suggest the possibility between 2030 and 2040, driven by scarcity (fixed supply of 21 million BTC) and institutional acceptance as digital gold.

[!NOTE] These projections depend heavily on market conditions, regulatory developments, and global economic factors. Bitcoin remains volatile and speculative.

## Pre-History:
### 40 years of several attempts made to create cryptocurrencies before Bitcoin:

### 1. DigiCash
Creator: David Chaum
Year of Creation: 1989
**Drawbacks**:
- Centralized: DigiCash required a trusted third party to process transactions, unlike Bitcoin's decentralized system.
- Lack of adoption: Limited interest from banks and institutions led to its failure.
Bankruptcy: DigiCash went bankrupt in 1998.

### 2. e-gold
Creator: Douglas Jackson and Barry Downey
Year of Creation: 1996
**Drawbacks:**
- Centralized: Controlled by a single entity, making it susceptible to legal actions.
- Legal issues: It was shut down in 2009 after being linked to money laundering.
- No pseudonymity: Transactions were not as private as Bitcoin.

### 3. Hashcash
Creator: **Adam Back**
Year of Creation: 1997
**Drawbacks:**
- Limited functionality: Originally designed to prevent email spam, not as a currency.
- No blockchain: It lacked a ledger system to record and verify transactions.
- Inefficient scaling: Computational costs made it impractical for widespread use.

### 4. b-money
Creator: Wei Dai
Year of Proposal: 1998
**Drawbacks**:
- Never implemented: It remained a theoretical proposal and was never deployed.
- No robust consensus: Lacked a practical mechanism to achieve distributed consensus like Bitcoin's proof-of-work.

### 5. Bit Gold
Creator: Nick Szabo
Year of Proposal: 1998
**Drawbacks:**
- No implementation: Like b-money, it was never fully realized.
- Lack of incentives: Did not have a built-in reward system for miners like Bitcoin.
- No global ledger: Did not use a blockchain to prevent double-spending.

Bitcoin improved upon these attempts by introducing a decentralized blockchain, robust proof-of-work consensus, pseudonymity, and a self-sustaining incentive structure for miners, which resolved many of the drawbacks of earlier systems.

### How many Bitcoin does its inventor Satoshi Nakamoto still own?
In the first seven months of Bitcoin's existence, Bitcoin creator Satoshi Nakamoto mined as many as **1.1 million** Bitcoin (out of total **21 million** coins). Satoshi's coins have never been spent or moved from their original mining addresses known as "Patoshi Blocks". Despite multiple bull runs, these coins remain untouched. The only possible exception is a small test transaction of 10 BTC that Satoshi sent to **Hal Finney** (_few speculators believes Hal as Satoshi_) in early Bitcoin testing. Bitcoin has a open ledger so anyone can view and confirm that Satoshi coins, which means Bicoin is more scarce than what we think for humanity. Satoshi treated Bitcoin as a **gift to humanity** and avoided personal financial gain. We can also say that this is test of Bitcoin’s integrity – If those coins ever move, it would cause a significant _stir_ in the community.
